# Flanker task for browsers
This is a browser-based version of the Eriksen flanker task built using jsPsych (http://www.jspsych.org). Currently it contains two congruent and 
two incongruent stimuli which are repeated randomly 20 times each. To store the data, I recommend using XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/) and the help provided by Josh de Leeuw
(http://docs.jspsych.org/features/data/#storing-data-in-jspsychs-data-structure).
